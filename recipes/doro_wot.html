        Doro Wat is one of the most famous of all African dishes. <br>
        You will find it in every Ethiopian restaurant and virtually<br>
        anyone who is familiar with African cuisine will have<br> 
        heard of it.<br>
        Traditionally Doro Wat is served with an Ethiopian flatbread<br>
        called injera.  Its kind of a spongy pancake made with teff<br>
        flour (a grain indigenous to the area), and the batter is left<br> 
        to ferment for up to 4 days before its used.  The injera is used<br> 
        in place of an eating utensil and is used to scoop up the chicken<br>
        stew.
